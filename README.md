# Doctrinal Mastery

Doctrinal Mastery is a quizlet clone I did for a client on Upwork using React. I imported 100 questions from the clients quizlet deck into a json file. Project scope was limited to just the front end for now due to very limited question additions or edits anticipated by client. A simple backend for the client to create, update, or delete questions is planned over the next few months along with an https certificate, but as of right now this is not needed by the client.

Client is a teacher with an audience of around 20,000 students. The clients flashcard deck needed to be taken off of Quizlet in order to reduce the friction from students being forced to signup for Quizlet. The goal was to make everything as simple as possible with as few steps as possible in order to increase the odds a student will choose to use the site.
